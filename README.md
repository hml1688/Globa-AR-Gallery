# Global-AR-Gallery
## Short Summary
This project is a mobile AR prototype that presents curated artworks from five global regions within an interactive miniature museum. Aggregating multiple world-class museum APIs, it enables users to explore time-filtered art collections by physically walking around and interacting with a spatially organized AR exhibition embedded in their real-world environment.
